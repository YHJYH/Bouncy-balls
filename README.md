# Bouncy-balls
This programme can make a series of calculations regarding abouncy ball bouncing above some minimum height.

1  Analytic approach

We can calculate the number of bounces analytically using conservation of energy. At height h the ball will have a potential energy of mgh, where the symbols have their usual meanings. After one bounce the ball reaches a height hη (0< η <1) where η takes into account energy lost during the bounce (an efficiency if you will). After a second bounce the ball will reach a height hη^2, and so on.
We can find the number of bounces above some minimum height,hmin, by examining the energy loss:
mgh_min=mghη^n
where n represents the number of bounces.

2  Expectations

Given user input for the initial height, minimum height of interest, and η; we expect to be able to calculate the following:
•The number of bounces over h_min,n.
•How many seconds it takes to complete these bounces. 
•Graphs, all kinds.
•some, magics?
